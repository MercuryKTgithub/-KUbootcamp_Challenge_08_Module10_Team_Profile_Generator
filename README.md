##### Project Description: 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
##### This project is about building another command-line interface node.js based application that takes in information about employees of a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage ( *the end result* ) that displays summaries for each team-member. This time the primary strategies are to use ES6 OOP to create classes that represent differnt types of employees and to utilize Jest TDD testing framework for correcting and validating the functionalities of class methods. This project also expects to a greater extend the usage of typed objects being fed in the inquirer prompt so as the prompt logic flows can be realized per specs. An HTML template is scripted to produce the layout that similar to the given mock-up, but is not required to follow exactly the mock-up ( *see screenshots below* ) In this version of command-line interface app, various input validations concerning character-type, character count, email format, etc are enforced besides the typical required field validation seen in previous project.
